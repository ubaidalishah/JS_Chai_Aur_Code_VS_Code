## Execution Context Explanation ##
# so when javascript code runs a global execution context is created which have 2 parts memory and execution so the variables which are declared globally are went to the memory with undefined values after that execution is started and the values are assigned to the variables keep in mind if the code have some function then function are went to they memory with its definition after that a functional exection context is created and in that the two parts are there, memory and execution in memory each variable of the function went and in execution values are assigned to that varibales and if some calculations are included then it is also done and this execution i mean the function execution context is deleted after executing the whole function other than that a stack is there which follows LIFO rule so if multiple function are there it follows the LIFO rule
