## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is a **reflection of my dedication** to mastering JavaScript, one video at a time.  
I am following the **"Chai aur Code"** playlist and for each video:
- 📂 **I create a new folder**.
- 📄 **Inside each folder, I create a JavaScript file** specifically for the concepts taught in that video.
- ✍️ **I code along, practice exercises, and sometimes add extra experiments** to deepen my understanding.

Every commit here shows **progress, practice, and passion** towards becoming a better JavaScript developer!

## 🚀 Why This Journey?

- To **build a strong foundation** in JavaScript, the language of the web.
- To **practice consistently**, because learning is not a one-day task.

- To **create a public record** of my growth, so I can look back and see how far I’ve come.
